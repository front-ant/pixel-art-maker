# Pixel Art Maker

This is one of my first more complex projects for the Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree. You can check out a live version [here](https://front-ant.github.io/pixel-art-maker/). It is a simple drawing app using the jQuery library that lets you create works of art using a number of pixels and colors of your choice.

I used the provided basic [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter) and added some custom design and the functionality. I also added some basic responsiveness to the page.

## How to Use

The interface is hopefully pretty self-explanatory. Select the desired height and width of your pixel canvas and a grid should appear that can be filled with different colors. Left click draws, right click deletes a pixel. Both drag-and-draw and drag-and-delete are supported. You might wanna be careful when creating a *really* big canvas - it might crash your browser!
